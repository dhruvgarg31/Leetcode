/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are given two identical eggs and you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to 
 * n.
 * 
 * You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher 
 * than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break.
 * 
 * In each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the 
 * egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in 
 * future moves.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can drop the first egg from floor 1 and the second egg from floor 2.
 * If the first egg breaks, we know that f = 0.
 * If the second egg breaks but the first egg didn't, we know that f = 1.
 * Otherwise, if both eggs survive, we know that f = 2.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 100
 * Output: 14
 * Explanation: One optimal strategy is:
 * - Drop the 1st egg at floor 9. If it breaks, we know f is between 0 and 8. Drop the 2nd egg starting
 *   from floor 1 and going up one at a time to find f within 7 more drops. Total drops is 1 + 7 = 8.
 * - If the 1st egg does not break, drop the 1st egg again at floor 22. If it breaks, we know f is 
 * between 9
 *   and 21. Drop the 2nd egg starting from floor 10 and going up one at a time to find f within 12 
 * more
 *   drops. Total drops is 2 + 12 = 14.
 * - If the 1st egg does not break again, follow a similar process dropping the 1st egg from floors 
 * 34, 45,
 *   55, 64, 72, 79, 85, 90, 94, 97, 99, and 100.
 * Regardless of the outcome, it takes at most 14 drops to determine f.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= n <= 1000
