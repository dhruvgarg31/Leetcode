/*************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.
 * 
 * Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5. For 
 * example, 6, 8 are ugly while 14 is not ugly since it includes another prime factor 7.
 * 
 * Note that 1 is typically treated as an ugly number.
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @jianchao.li.fighter for adding this problem and creating 
 * all test cases.
 *
