/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree with N nodes, each node in the tree has node.val coins, and there 
 * are N coins total.
 * 
 * In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another.  (The 
 * move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)
 * 
 * Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [3,0,0]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its 
 * right child.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [0,3,0]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: From the left child of the root, we move two coins to the root [taking two moves].  
 * Then, we move one coin from the root of the tree to the right child.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: [1,0,2]
 * Output: 2
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * Input: [1,0,0,null,3]
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 	1<= N <= 100
 * 	0 <= node.val <= N
