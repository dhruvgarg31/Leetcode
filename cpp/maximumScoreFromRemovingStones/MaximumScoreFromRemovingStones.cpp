/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a​​​​​​, b,​​​​​​ and c​​​​​​ 
 * respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 
 * 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there 
 * are no more available moves).
 * 
 * Given three integers a​​​​​, b,​​​​​ and c​​​​​, return the maximum score you can get.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: a = 2, b = 4, c = 6
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The starting state is (2, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
 * - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 4, 5)
 * - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 4, 4)
 * - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
 * - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
 * - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
 * - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
 * There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 6 points.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: a = 4, b = 4, c = 6
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: The starting state is (4, 4, 6). One optimal set of moves is:
 * - Take from 1st and 2nd piles, state is now (3, 3, 6)
 * - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (2, 3, 5)
 * - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (1, 3, 4)
 * - Take from 1st and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 3, 3)
 * - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 2, 2)
 * - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 1, 1)
 * - Take from 2nd and 3rd piles, state is now (0, 0, 0)
 * There are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends. Total: 7 points.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: a = 1, b = 8, c = 8
 * Output: 8
 * Explanation: One optimal set of moves is to take from the 2nd and 3rd piles for 8 turns until they 
 * are empty.
 * After that, there are fewer than two non-empty piles, so the game ends.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= a, b, c <= 105
