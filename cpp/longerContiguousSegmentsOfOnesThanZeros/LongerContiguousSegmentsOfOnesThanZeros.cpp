/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given a binary string s, return true if the longest contiguous segment of 1s is strictly longer 
 * than the longest contiguous segment of 0s in s. Return false otherwise.
 * 
 * 	For example, in s = "110100010" the longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2, and the 
 * longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3.
 * 
 * Note that if there are no 0s, then the longest contiguous segment of 0s is considered to have 
 * length 0. The same applies if there are no 1s.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "1101"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation:
 * The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "1101"
 * The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "1101"
 * The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "111000"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 * The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: "111000"
 * The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111000"
 * The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "110100010"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation:
 * The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "110100010"
 * The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "110100010"
 * The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 100
 * 	s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
