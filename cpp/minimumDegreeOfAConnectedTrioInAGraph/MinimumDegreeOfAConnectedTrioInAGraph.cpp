/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer n which is the number of nodes in the 
 * graph and an array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge 
 * between ui and vi.
 * 
 * A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of them.
 * 
 * The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the 
 * other is not.
 * 
 * Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected 
 * trios.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[3,2],[4,1],[5,2],[3,6]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There is exactly one trio, which is [1,2,3]. The edges that form its degree are bolded 
 * in the figure above.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: n = 7, edges = [[1,3],[4,1],[4,3],[2,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,5],[2,6]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There are exactly three trios:
 * 1) [1,4,3] with degree 0.
 * 2) [2,5,6] with degree 2.
 * 3) [5,6,7] with degree 2.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	2 <= n <= 400
 * 	edges[i].length == 2
 * 	1 <= edges.length <= n * (n-1) / 2
 * 	1 <= ui, vi <= n
 * 	ui != vi
 * 	There are no repeated edges.
