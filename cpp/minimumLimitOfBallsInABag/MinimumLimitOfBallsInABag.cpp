/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an 
 * integer maxOperations.
 * 
 * You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:
 * 
 * 	Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
 * 
 * 		For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new 
 * bags of 2 and 3 balls.
 * 
 * Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the 
 * operations.
 * 
 * Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 
 * - Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
 * - Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
 * The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * - Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
 * - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
 * - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
 * - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
 * The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: nums = [7,17], maxOperations = 2
 * Output: 7
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= nums.length <= 105
 * 	1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109
