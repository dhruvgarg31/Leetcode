 *
 * According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular 
 * automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 * 
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell 
 * interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules 
 * (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
 * 
 * 	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * 	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * 	Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
 * 	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * 
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. 
 * The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current 
 * state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: 
 * [
 *   [0,1,0],
 *   [0,0,1],
 *   [1,1,1],
 *   [0,0,0]
 * ]
 * Output: 
 * [
 *   [0,0,0],
 *   [1,0,1],
 *   [0,1,1],
 *   [0,1,0]
 * ]
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * 
 * 	Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: 
 * You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
 * 	In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is 
 * infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How 
 * would you address these problems?
 *
