/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.
 * 
 * It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.
 * 
 * Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.
 * 
 * Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.
 * 
 * It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t than before.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
 * Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 	Each test case will have at most 10000 calls to ping.
 * 	Each test case will call ping with strictly increasing values of t.
 * 	Each call to ping will have 1 <= t <= 10^9.
 *
