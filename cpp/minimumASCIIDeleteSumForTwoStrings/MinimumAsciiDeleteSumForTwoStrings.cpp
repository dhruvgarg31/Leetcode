/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "sea", s2 = "eat"
 * Output: 231
 * Explanation: Deleting "s" from "sea" adds the ASCII value of "s" (115) to the sum.
 * Deleting "t" from "eat" adds 116 to the sum.
 * At the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "delete", s2 = "leet"
 * Output: 403
 * Explanation: Deleting "dee" from "delete" to turn the string into "let",
 * adds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting "e" from "leet" adds 101[e] to the sum.
 * At the end, both strings are equal to "let", and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.
 * If instead we turned both strings into "lee" or "eet", we would get answers of 433 or 417, which 
 * are higher.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 0 .
 * All elements of each string will have an ASCII value in [97, 122].
