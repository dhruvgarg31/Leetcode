/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are given a 2D integer array orders, where each orders[i] = [pricei, amounti, orderTypei] 
 * denotes that amounti orders have been placed of type orderTypei at the price pricei. The orderTypei 
 * is:
 * 
 * 	0 if it is a batch of buy orders, or
 * 	1 if it is a batch of sell orders.
 * 
 * Note that orders[i] represents a batch of amounti independent orders with the same price and order 
 * type. All orders represented by orders[i] will be placed before all orders represented by 
 * orders[i+1] for all valid i.
 * 
 * There is a backlog that consists of orders that have not been executed. The backlog is initially 
 * empty. When an order is placed, the following happens:
 * 
 * 	If the order is a buy order, you look at the sell order with the smallest price in the 
 * backlog. If that sell order's price is smaller than or equal to the current buy order's price, they 
 * will match and be executed, and that sell order will be removed from the backlog. Else, the buy 
 * order is added to the backlog.
 * 	Vice versa, if the order is a sell order, you look at the buy order with the largest price 
 * in the backlog. If that buy order's price is larger than or equal to the current sell order's 
 * price, they will match and be executed, and that buy order will be removed from the backlog. Else, 
 * the sell order is added to the backlog.
 * 
 * Return the total amount of orders in the backlog after placing all the orders from the input. Since 
 * this number can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: orders = [[10,5,0],[15,2,1],[25,1,1],[30,4,0]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
 * - 5 orders of type buy with price 10 are placed. There are no sell orders, so the 5 orders are 
 * added to the backlog.
 * - 2 orders of type sell with price 15 are placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than 
 * or equal to 15, so the 2 orders are added to the backlog.
 * - 1 order of type sell with price 25 is placed. There are no buy orders with prices larger than or 
 * equal to 25 in the backlog, so this order is added to the backlog.
 * - 4 orders of type buy with price 30 are placed. The first 2 orders are matched with the 2 sell 
 * orders of the least price, which is 15 and these 2 sell orders are removed from the backlog. The 
 * 3rd order is matched with the sell order of the least price, which is 25 and this sell order is 
 * removed from the backlog. Then, there are no more sell orders in the backlog, so the 4th order is 
 * added to the backlog.
 * Finally, the backlog has 5 buy orders with price 10, and 1 buy order with price 30. So the total 
 * number of orders in the backlog is 6.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: orders = [[7,1000000000,1],[15,3,0],[5,999999995,0],[5,1,1]]
 * Output: 999999984
 * Explanation: Here is what happens with the orders:
 * - 109 orders of type sell with price 7 are placed. There are no buy orders, so the 109 orders are 
 * added to the backlog.
 * - 3 orders of type buy with price 15 are placed. They are matched with the 3 sell orders with the 
 * least price which is 7, and those 3 sell orders are removed from the backlog.
 * - 999999995 orders of type buy with price 5 are placed. The least price of a sell order is 7, so 
 * the 999999995 orders are added to the backlog.
 * - 1 order of type sell with price 5 is placed. It is matched with the buy order of the highest 
 * price, which is 5, and that buy order is removed from the backlog.
 * Finally, the backlog has (1000000000-3) sell orders with price 7, and (999999995-1) buy orders with 
 * price 5. So the total number of orders = 1999999991, which is equal to 999999984 % (109 + 7).
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= orders.length <= 105
 * 	orders[i].length == 3
 * 	1 <= pricei, amounti <= 109
 * 	orderTypei is either 0 or 1.
