/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * 
 * If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of 
 * the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
 * 
 * Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
 *              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
 *
