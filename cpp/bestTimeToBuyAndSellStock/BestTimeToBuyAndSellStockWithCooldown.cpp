/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * 
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like 
 * (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 * 
 * 	You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock 
 * before you buy again).
 * 	After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
 * Output: 3 
 * Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
