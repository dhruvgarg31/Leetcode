/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * There are 2N people a company is planning to interview. The cost of flying the i-th person to city 
 * A is costs[i][0], and the cost of flying the i-th person to city B is costs[i][1].
 * 
 * Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly N people arrive in each 
 * city.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
 * Output: 110
 * Explanation: 
 * The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
 * The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
 * The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
 * The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.
 * 
 * The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 	1 <= costs.length <= 100
 * 	It is guaranteed that costs.length is even.
 * 	1 <= costs[i][0], costs[i][1] <= 1000
