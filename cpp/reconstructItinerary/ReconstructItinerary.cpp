/*************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival 
 * airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong 
 * to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has 
 * the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary 
 * ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
 * All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
 * You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
 * 
 *     Example 1:
 *     tickets = [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
 *     Return ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"].
 * 
 *     Example 2:
 *     tickets = [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
 *     Return ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"].
 *     Another possible reconstruction is ["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"]. But it 
 * is larger in lexical order.

/*
 This problem's description really confuse me.
 
 for examples:
    1) [["JFK", "PEK"], ["JFK", "SHA"], ["SHA", "JFK"]], which has two itineraries: 
       a) JFK -> PEK, 
       b) JFK -> SHA -> JFK -> PEK
       The a) is smaller than b), because PEK < SHA, however the b) is correct answer.
       So, it means we need use all of tickets.
       
    2) [["JFK", "PEK"], ["JFK", "SHA"]], which also has two itineraries:
       a) JFK -> PEK
       b) JFK -> SHA
       for my understanding, the JFK -> SHA is the correct one, 
       however, the correct answer is JFK -> SHA -> PEK.
       I don't understand, why the correct answer is not JFK -> PEK -> SHA
       That really does not make sense to me.
       
 All right, we need assume all of the tickets can be connected in one itinerary.
 Then, it's easy to have a DFS algorithm.
