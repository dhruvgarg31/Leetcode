/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * A string s is nice if, for every letter of the alphabet that s contains, it appears both in 
 * uppercase and lowercase. For example, "abABB" is nice because 'A' and 'a' appear, and 'B' and 'b' 
 * appear. However, "abA" is not because 'b' appears, but 'B' does not.
 * 
 * Given a string s, return the longest substring of s that is nice. If there are multiple, return the 
 * substring of the earliest occurrence. If there are none, return an empty string.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "YazaAay"
 * Output: "aAa"
 * Explanation: "aAa" is a nice string because 'A/a' is the only letter of the alphabet in s, and both 
 * 'A' and 'a' appear.
 * "aAa" is the longest nice substring.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "Bb"
 * Output: "Bb"
 * Explanation: "Bb" is a nice string because both 'B' and 'b' appear. The whole string is a substring.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s = "c"
 * Output: ""
 * Explanation: There are no nice substrings.
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * Input: s = "dDzeE"
 * Output: "dD"
 * Explanation: Both "dD" and "eE" are the longest nice substrings.
 * As there are multiple longest nice substrings, return "dD" since it occurs earlier.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s.length <= 100
 * 	s consists of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
