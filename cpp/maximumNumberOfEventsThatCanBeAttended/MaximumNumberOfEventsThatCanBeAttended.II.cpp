/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]. The ith event 
 * starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of 
 * valuei. You are also given an integer k which represents the maximum number of events you can 
 * attend.
 * 
 * You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the 
 * entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one 
 * of them starts and the other ends on the same day.
 * 
 * Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
 * Output: 10
 * Explanation: Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
 * Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do not have to attend k 
 * events.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: events = [[1,1,1],[2,2,2],[3,3,3],[4,4,4]], k = 3
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: Although the events do not overlap, you can only attend 3 events. Pick the highest 
 * valued three.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= k <= events.length
 * 	1 <= k * events.length <= 106
 * 	1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 109
 * 	1 <= valuei <= 106
