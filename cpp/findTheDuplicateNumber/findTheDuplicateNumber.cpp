/*************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and 
 * n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist.
 * Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.
 *
 * Note:
 * > You must not modify the array (assume the array is read only).
 * > You must use only constant, O(1) extra space.
 * > Your runtime complexity should be less than O(n2).
 * > There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than
 *   once.

 * cases.
