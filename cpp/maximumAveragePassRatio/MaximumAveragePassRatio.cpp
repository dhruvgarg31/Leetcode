/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * There is a school that has classes of students and each class will be having a final exam. You are 
 * given a 2D integer array classes, where classes[i] = [passi, totali]. You know beforehand that in 
 * the ith class, there are totali total students, but only passi number of students will pass the 
 * exam.
 * 
 * You are also given an integer extraStudents. There are another extraStudents brilliant students 
 * that are guaranteed to pass the exam of any class they are assigned to. You want to assign each of 
 * the extraStudents students to a class in a way that maximizes the average pass ratio across all the 
 * classes.
 * 
 * The pass ratio of a class is equal to the number of students of the class that will pass the exam 
 * divided by the total number of students of the class. The average pass ratio is the sum of pass 
 * ratios of all the classes divided by the number of the classes.
 * 
 * Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after assigning the extraStudents students. Answers 
 * within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2
 * Output: 0.78333
 * Explanation: You can assign the two extra students to the first class. The average pass ratio will 
 * be equal to (3/4 + 3/5 + 2/2) / 3 = 0.78333.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4
 * Output: 0.53485
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= classes.length <= 105
 * 	classes[i].length == 2
 * 	1 <= passi <= totali <= 105
 * 	1 <= extraStudents <= 105
