/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high 
 * (inclusive).
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: low = 3, high = 7
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: low = 8, high = 10
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	0 <= low <= high <= 10^9
