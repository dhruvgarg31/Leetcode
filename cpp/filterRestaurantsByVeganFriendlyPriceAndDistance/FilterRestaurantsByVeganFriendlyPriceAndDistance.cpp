/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given the array restaurants where  restaurants[i] = [idi, ratingi, veganFriendlyi, pricei, 
 * distancei]. You have to filter the restaurants using three filters.
 * 
 * The veganFriendly filter will be either true (meaning you should only include restaurants with 
 * veganFriendlyi set to true) or false (meaning you can include any restaurant). In addition, you 
 * have the filters maxPrice and maxDistance which are the maximum value for price and distance of 
 * restaurants you should consider respectively.
 * 
 * Return the array of restaurant IDs after filtering, ordered by rating from highest to lowest. For 
 * restaurants with the same rating, order them by id from highest to lowest. For simplicity 
 * veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly take value 1 when it is true, and 0 when it is false.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], 
 * veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
 * Output: [3,1,5] 
 * Explanation: 
 * The restaurants are:
 * Restaurant 1 [id=1, rating=4, veganFriendly=1, price=40, distance=10]
 * Restaurant 2 [id=2, rating=8, veganFriendly=0, price=50, distance=5]
 * Restaurant 3 [id=3, rating=8, veganFriendly=1, price=30, distance=4]
 * Restaurant 4 [id=4, rating=10, veganFriendly=0, price=10, distance=3]
 * Restaurant 5 [id=5, rating=1, veganFriendly=1, price=15, distance=1] 
 * After filter restaurants with veganFriendly = 1, maxPrice = 50 and maxDistance = 10 we have 
 * restaurant 3, restaurant 1 and restaurant 5 (ordered by rating from highest to lowest). 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], 
 * veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 50, maxDistance = 10
 * Output: [4,3,2,1,5]
 * Explanation: The restaurants are the same as in example 1, but in this case the filter 
 * veganFriendly = 0, therefore all restaurants are considered.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: restaurants = [[1,4,1,40,10],[2,8,0,50,5],[3,8,1,30,4],[4,10,0,10,3],[5,1,1,15,1]], 
 * veganFriendly = 0, maxPrice = 30, maxDistance = 3
 * Output: [4,5]
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= restaurants.length <= 10^4
 * 	restaurants[i].length == 5
 * 	1 <= idi, ratingi, pricei, distancei <= 10^5
 * 	1 <= maxPrice, maxDistance <= 10^5
 * 	veganFriendlyi and veganFriendly are 0 or 1.
 * 	All idi are distinct.
