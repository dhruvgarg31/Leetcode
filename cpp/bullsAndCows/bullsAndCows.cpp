/*************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with your friend: You write a 
 * 4-digit secret number and ask your friend to guess it. Each time your friend guesses
 * a number, you give a hint. The hint tells your friend how many digits are in the
 * correct positions (called "bulls") and how many digits are in the wrong positions
 * (called "cows"). Your friend will use those hints to find out the secret number.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * Secret number:  "1807"
 * Friend's guess: "7810"
 * Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
 * Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend's guess,
 * use A to indicate the bulls and B to indicate the cows. In the above example, your
 * function should return "1A3B".
 * 
 * Please note that both secret number and friend's guess may contain duplicate digits,
 * for example:
 * 
 * Secret number:  "1123"
 * Friend's guess: "0111"
 * In this case, the 1st 1 in friend's guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd 1 is a cow, and
 * your function should return "1A1B".
 * You may assume that the secret number and your friend's guess only contain digits,
 * and their lengths are always equal.
 *

 * Special thanks to @jeantimex for adding this problem and creating all test cases.
