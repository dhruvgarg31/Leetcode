/***************************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * You are given two strings s1 and s2 of equal length. A string swap is an operation where you choose 
 * two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.
 * 
 * Return true if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing at most one string swap on 
 * exactly one of the strings. Otherwise, return false.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * Input: s1 = "abcd", s2 = "dcba"
 * Output: false
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 	1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
 * 	s1.length == s2.length
 * 	s1 and s2 consist of only lowercase English letters.
