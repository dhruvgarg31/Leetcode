/*************************************************************************************** 
 *
 * Given an Iterator class interface with methods: next() and hasNext(), design and 
 * implement a PeekingIterator that support the peek() operation -- it essentially 
 * peek() at the element that will be returned by the next call to next().
 * 
 * Here is an example. Assume that the iterator is initialized to the beginning of the 
 * list: [1, 2, 3].
 * 
 * Call next() gets you 1, the first element in the list.
 * 
 * Now you call peek() and it returns 2, the next element. Calling next() after that 
 * still return 2.
 * 
 * You call next() the final time and it returns 3, the last element. Calling hasNext() 
 * after that should return false.
 * 
 *   Think of "looking ahead". You want to cache the next element.
 *   Is one variable sufficient? Why or why not?
 *   Test your design with call order of peek() before next() vs next() before peek().
 *   For a clean implementation, check out Google's guava library source code.
 * 
 * Follow up: How would you extend your design to be generic and work with all types, 
 * not just integer?
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @porker2008 for adding this problem and creating all test 
 * cases.
