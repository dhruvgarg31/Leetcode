/**********************************************************************************
 *
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the
 * tree.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is
 * defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as
 * descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
 *

 *
 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another example
 * is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according
 * to the LCA definition.
